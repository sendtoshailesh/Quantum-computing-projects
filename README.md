# Quantum-computing-projects
Exploring the quantum computing projects for machine learnings. feel free to collaborate.


I apologize for the confusion. You're right - the earlier classification was correct, but the projects weren't on separate lines. Here's the corrected version with proper classification and each project on a separate line:
